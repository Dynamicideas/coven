When Geezer asks you to be captain of Armagh, it's something you really have to give your all to. \\n\\\"He'd obviously seen something in me. I wouldn't be the biggest of talkers but I prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way.\\\"\\nUnfortunately for O'Neill, the momentum and confidence built from an eye-catching Division One campaign would be shattered in the Ulster Championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in Armagh's 1-16 to 0-12 defeat by Donegal in Ballybofey.\\n\\\"I felt fit all the way through the year - I was playing well but against Donegal I had an absolute nightmare, nothing went over for me,\\\" added O'Neill, who has returned from a summer in America to aid Crossmaglen's quest for a first Armagh SFC title since 2019.  \\n\\\"I couldn't get on the ball, couldn't do anything, but against Tyrone and Donegal [in the All-Ireland qualifiers] again I started to kick on. [The All-Ireland quarter-final against] Galway, I had a good first half but was poor after that. \\n\\\"But it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me. I was playing well in previous years, but this year I felt near on top of my game and that if I played well I'd be hard stopped.\\\"\\nBeing asked to lead his county, lighting up Croke Park, an All-Star nomination; O'Neill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022.\\nHowever, he maintains that any post-mortem on the inter-county campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of Armagh's All-Ireland exit, losing to Galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory.\\nIn an incident-packed encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a six-month suspension for O'Neill's team-mate Tiernan Kelly for eye-gouging, O'Neill scored 0-4 and was the only Orchard player to score in the shootout.\\nHis most memorable contribution, though, came in the dying embers of regulation time, nailing a 50m free to force extra-time after Armagh had roared their way back from a six-point deficit with two injury-time goals. \\nIn extra-time, Jemar Hall's score looked to have sealed a semi-final spot for Armagh before Cillian McDaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout. \\n\\\"You look back at Galway with regrets coming from that game, the way we lost the penalty shootout,\\\" admits O'Neill.  \\n\\\"We didn't really perform in the second half. We had it won in extra-time, lost it again, got back into it. \\n\\\"There are regrets but we feel we've progressed through the year. We let ourselves down in the first game against Donegal but we came back against Tyrone and Donegal (in the qualifiers) and made a bit of a statement. \\n\\\"We were hoping to push on against Galway and get to that semi-final where we felt we'd have a chance coming up against Derry or Clare, it turned out to be Derry.\\n\\\"Then you see how close Galway ran Kerry in the final and it just enters your head 'what if' we did get over the Galway game and the circumstances we did lose, it's a bitter pill to swallow but we've got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year.\\\"\"\n

a verve and swagger that forced many onlookers to sit up and take notice\\nfor oneill it set the tone for the next five months and while he was ultimately forced to grapple with crushing disappointment the crossmaglen rangers ace feels that 2022 was the year in which he really made his mark on the intercounty scene \\nit felt to an extent that it was oneill told the gaa social when asked by thomas niblock if he considers 2022 his breakout season  \\nat the start of the year geezer came to me and nugent and asked us to be captains of the team when geezer asks you to be captain of armagh its something you really have to give your all to \\nhed obviously seen something in me i wouldnt be the biggest of talkers but i prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way\\nunfortunately for oneill the momentum and confidence built from an eyecatching division one campaign would be shattered in the ulster championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in armaghs 116 to 012 defeat by donegal in ballybofey\\ni felt fit all the way through the year  i was playing well but against donegal i had an absolute nightmare nothing went over for me added oneill who has returned from a summer in america to aid crossmaglens quest for a first armagh sfc title since 2019  \\ni couldnt get on the ball couldnt do anything but against tyrone and donegal in the allireland qualifiers again i started to kick on the allireland quarterfinal against galway i had a good first half but was poor after that \\nbut it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me i was playing well in previous years but this year i felt near on top of my game and that if i played well id be hard stopped\\nbeing asked to lead his county lighting up croke park an allstar nomination oneill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022\\nhowever he maintains that any postmortem on the intercounty campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of armaghs allireland exit losing to galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory\\nin an incidentpacked encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a sixmonth suspension for oneills teammate tiernan kelly for eyegouging oneill scored 04 and was the only orchard player to score in the shootout\\nhis most memorable contribution though came in the dying embers of regulation time nailing a 50m free to force extratime after armagh had roared their way back from a sixpoint deficit with two injurytime goals \\nin extratime jemar halls score looked to have sealed a semifinal spot for armagh before cillian mcdaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout \\nyou look back at galway with regrets coming from that game the way we lost the penalty shootout admits oneill  \\nwe didnt really perform in the second half we had it won in extratime lost it again got back into it \\nthere are regrets but we feel weve progressed through the year we let ourselves down in the first game against donegal but we came back against tyrone and donegal in the qualifiers and made a bit of a statement \\nwe were hoping to push on against galway and get to that semifinal where we felt wed have a chance coming up against derry or clare it turned out to be derry\\nthen you see how close galway ran kerry in the final and it just enters your head what if we did get over the galway game and the circumstances we did lose its a bitter pill to swallow but weve got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year\"\n        ],\n

intercounty season with Armagh\\nAs he geared up for his fourth year in the senior setup he received a pleasant surprise being asked by boss Kieran McGeeney to cocaptain the team alongside Aidan Nugent \\nONeill was well aware of the significance but any suspicions that the heightened responsibility would weigh heavily on his broad shoulders were emphatically dispelled by his virtuoso display in the Division One opener win over Dublin \\nGracing Croke Parks hallowed turf for the first time ONeill scored 14 from fullforward as Armagh marked their topflight return after a 10year absence with a verve and swagger that forced many onlookers to sit up and take notice\\nFor ONeill it set the tone for the next five months and while he was ultimately forced to grapple with crushing disappointment the Crossmaglen Rangers ace feels that 2022 was the year in which he really made his mark on the intercounty scene \\nIt felt to an extent that it was ONeill told The GAA Social when asked by Thomas Niblock if he considers 2022 his breakout season  \\nAt the start of the year Geezer came to me and Nugent and asked us to be captains of the team When Geezer asks you to be captain of Armagh its something you really have to give your all to \\nHed obviously seen something in me I wouldnt be the biggest of talkers but I prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way\\nUnfortunately for ONeill the momentum and confidence built from an eyecatching Division One campaign would be shattered in the Ulster Championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in Armaghs 116 to 012 defeat by Donegal in Ballybofey\\nI felt fit all the way through the year  I was playing well but against Donegal I had an absolute nightmare nothing went over for me added ONeill who has returned from a summer in America to aid Crossmaglens quest for a first Armagh SFC title since 2019  \\nI couldnt get on the ball couldnt do anything but against Tyrone and Donegal in the AllIreland qualifiers again I started to kick on The AllIreland quarterfinal against Galway I had a good first half but was poor after that \\nBut it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me I was playing well in previous years but this year I felt near on top of my game and that if I played well Id be hard stopped\\nBeing asked to lead his county lighting up Croke Park an AllStar nomination ONeill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022\\nHowever he maintains that any postmortem on the intercounty campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of Armaghs AllIreland exit losing to Galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory\\nIn an incidentpacked encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a sixmonth suspension for ONeills teammate Tiernan Kelly for eyegouging ONeill scored 04 and was the only Orchard player to score in the shootout\\nHis most memorable contribution though came in the dying embers of regulation time nailing a 50m free to force extratime after Armagh had roared their way back from a sixpoint deficit with two injurytime goals \\nIn extratime Jemar Halls score looked to have sealed a semifinal spot for Armagh before Cillian McDaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout \\nYou look back at Galway with regrets coming from that game the way we lost the penalty shootout admits ONeill  \\nWe didnt really perform in the second half We had it won in extratime lost it again got back into it \\nThere are regrets but we feel weve progressed through the year We let ourselves down in the first game against Donegal but we came back against Tyrone and Donegal in the qualifiers and made a bit of a statement \\nWe were hoping to push on against Galway and get to that semifinal where we felt wed have a chance coming up against Derry or Clare it turned out to be Derry\\nThen you see how close Galway ran Kerry in the final and it just enters your head what if we did get over the Galway game and the circumstances we did lose its a bitter pill to swallow but weve got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year\"\n        ],\n

When Geezer asks you to be captain of Armagh, it's something you really have to give your all to. \\n\\\"He'd obviously seen something in me. I wouldn't be the biggest of talkers but I prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way.\\\"\\nUnfortunately for O'Neill, the momentum and confidence built from an eye-catching Division One campaign would be shattered in the Ulster Championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in Armagh's 1-16 to 0-12 defeat by Donegal in Ballybofey.\\n\\\"I felt fit all the way through the year - I was playing well but against Donegal I had an absolute nightmare, nothing went over for me,\\\" added O'Neill, who has returned from a summer in America to aid Crossmaglen's quest for a first Armagh SFC title since 2019.  \\n\\\"I couldn't get on the ball, couldn't do anything, but against Tyrone and Donegal [in the All-Ireland qualifiers] again I started to kick on. [The All-Ireland quarter-final against] Galway, I had a good first half but was poor after that. \\n\\\"But it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me. I was playing well in previous years, but this year I felt near on top of my game and that if I played well I'd be hard stopped.\\\"\\nBeing asked to lead his county, lighting up Croke Park, an All-Star nomination; O'Neill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022.\\nHowever, he maintains that any post-mortem on the inter-county campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of Armagh's All-Ireland exit, losing to Galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory.\\nIn an incident-packed encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a six-month suspension for O'Neill's team-mate Tiernan Kelly for eye-gouging, O'Neill scored 0-4 and was the only Orchard player to score in the shootout.\\nHis most memorable contribution, though, came in the dying embers of regulation time, nailing a 50m free to force extra-time after Armagh had roared their way back from a six-point deficit with two injury-time goals. \\nIn extra-time, Jemar Hall's score looked to have sealed a semi-final spot for Armagh before Cillian McDaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout. \\n\\\"You look back at Galway with regrets coming from that game, the way we lost the penalty shootout,\\\" admits O'Neill.  \\n\\\"We didn't really perform in the second half. We had it won in extra-time, lost it again, got back into it. \\n\\\"There are regrets but we feel we've progressed through the year. We let ourselves down in the first game against Donegal but we came back against Tyrone and Donegal (in the qualifiers) and made a bit of a statement. \\n\\\"We were hoping to push on against Galway and get to that semi-final where we felt we'd have a chance coming up against Derry or Clare, it turned out to be Derry.\\n\\\"Then you see how close Galway ran Kerry in the final and it just enters your head 'what if' we did get over the Galway game and the circumstances we did lose, it's a bitter pill to swallow but we've got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year.\\\"\"\n

Here are some of the ways the Autumn Statement will affect you. \\nYou start to pay income tax on annual earnings of more than \\u00a312,570, charged at 20%. You then pay tax of 40% on earnings over \\u00a350,270 a year, although the bands are different in Scotland.\\n- or tax thresholds - had already been frozen until 2026, rather than going up in line with prices as you might normally expect. \\nr has now extended that freeze for a further two years. That means any kind of pay rise could drag you into a higher tax bracket. Even if it does not, it will almost certainly mean a greater proportion of your income is taxed.\\nghest rate of income tax - which is 45% currently on earnings above \\u00a3150,000 - will be paid on earnings of more than \\u00a3125,140 from April instead, the chancellor has announced. That means the highest paid could pay hundreds of pounds more a year in income tax.\\nSpring Statement of March and September's mini-budget both included plans to cut the basic rate of income tax. Unsurprisingly, there were no such promises this time.\\nreshold at which people start to pay inheritance tax will also be frozen, and the dividend allowance (the amount you can receive each year in dividends, if you own shares, before paying tax) will be cut from \\u00a32,000 to \\u00a31,000 next year and then to \\u00a3500 from April 2024. The allowance stood at \\u00a35,000 as recently as 2018.\\nual allowance before capital gains tax is paid will also be reduced from \\u00a312,300 to \\u00a36,000 in April and then to \\u00a33,000 a year later. This tax is paid when you sell an asset, such as company shares or a second home.\\nStrains over the cost of living have centred on rising prices. The rate at which prices rise is measured by inflation, currently at 11.1%, which means that a typical item that cost \\u00a3100 a year ago will cost \\u00a3111.10 today.\\ngood news from the government's independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - is that the inflation rate will drop to 7.4% next year. The target set for inflation is 2%.\\nHowever, a fall in the inflation rate does not mean that prices in the shops will be going down. It just means that they will be going up more slowly than now.\\nOBR said soaring inflation would still hit households' real disposable income - a measure of living standards - by the largest amount since official records began in 1956-57, falling by 4.3% in the year to April.\\nEven so, the OBR forecast that inflation may turn negative, in other words prices may fall by late 2024.\\nAt present, there is a government cap on domestic energy bills, known as the Energy Price Guarantee. It limits the price per unit of energy used, not the total bill. It means that since October, the household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays \\u00a32,500 a year.\\nwas due to expire in April, leaving the prospect of the typical annual bill going up to \\u00a33,700, according to analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight.\\nMr Hunt said that this cap would be extended for a further 12 months, but would be less generous than now - so the typical household pays \\u00a33,000 a year. Mr Hunt predicted that would save the typical household \\u00a3500 in a year.\\ngovernment is also pumping more money into energy efficiency schemes.\\nA host of cost-of-living payments have been made during the latter half of this year, including a \\u00a3400 discount off everyone's energy bills this winter. Others were directed at those on lower-incomes on benefits, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\\nWhile the universal payment will end, there will be more targeted support next year. That will amount to \\u00a3900 to households on means-tested benefits, \\u00a3300 to pensioner households, and \\u00a3150 for those on disability benefits. \\nusing heating oil will receive a payment of \\u00a3200 this winter, rather than \\u00a3100 as previously planned.\\nUnder the \\\"triple lock\\\", the state pension is supposed to increase each year in line with the highest of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index in September), the average increase in wages across the UK, or 2.5%.\\nAfter months of uncertainty, the chancellor confirmed that the state pension would go up by 10.1%, to match inflation.\\nwill see the \\\"new\\\" state pension, currently worth \\u00a3185.15 a week, go up to \\u00a3203.85. The basic state pension, for those who reached state pension age before April 2016, is currently \\u00a3141.85 a week, and will go up to \\u00a3156.20. That can be topped up for those on low incomes with pension credit, which will also go up by 10.1%.\\ngovernment's review on the age at which the state pension is received, currently 66 and going up to 67, will be published early next year.\\nSome disability benefits - such as the personal independence payment - must rise, by law, in line with inflation each year. That happens in April, based on the previous September's inflation figure - which this time is 10.1%.\\nHowever, rises in most means-tested benefits - most significantly universal credit, which is received by about six million people - and tax credits are a decision for ministers.\\nr said these too would go up by 10.1%, which he said would mean a family on universal credit would benefit next year by around \\u00a3600.\\nMr Hunt said the government will cap the increase in social rents in England at a maximum of 7% in 2023-24, rather than the 11% potential rise under previous rules.\\nminimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - is \\u00a39.50 an hour. This will rise to \\u00a310.42 in April - a move that affects about two million people. It is employers who must shoulder this cost.\\nMinisters will have to scrutinise the recommendations for public sector pay rises, such as salary increases for teachers, nurses and the armed forces. Widespread, ongoing disputes are expected.\\nAt present, councils in England must hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 3%, but the chancellor said he would raise this to 5%.\\nOBR said that could see the average Band D council tax bill rise by \\u00a3250 a year by 2027-28.\\nIn September, the government said a cut in stamp duty tax in England and Northern Ireland for some house buyers would be permanent.\\nrice at which stamp duty is paid was doubled from \\u00a3125,000 to \\u00a3250,000 (\\u00a3425,000 for first time buyers) and discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers applied to properties up to \\u00a3625,000, rather than \\u00a3500,000.\\nr has now introduced a deadline, which will see these cuts reversed at the end of March 2025.\\nr has announced electric vehicles will no longer be exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2025.\\nCurrently there are different rates depending on the type of vehicle but electric vehicles are exempt.\\nHow does the Autumn Statement affect you?

When Geezer asks you to be captain of Armagh, it's something you really have to give your all to. \\n\\\"He'd obviously seen something in me. I wouldn't be the biggest of talkers but I prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way.\\\"\\nUnfortunately for O'Neill, the momentum and confidence built from an eye-catching Division One campaign would be shattered in the Ulster Championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in Armagh's 1-16 to 0-12 defeat by Donegal in Ballybofey.\\n\\\"I felt fit all the way through the year - I was playing well but against Donegal I had an absolute nightmare, nothing went over for me,\\\" added O'Neill, who has returned from a summer in America to aid Crossmaglen's quest for a first Armagh SFC title since 2019.  \\n\\\"I couldn't get on the ball, couldn't do anything, but against Tyrone and Donegal [in the All-Ireland qualifiers] again I started to kick on. [The All-Ireland quarter-final against] Galway, I had a good first half but was poor after that. \\n\\\"But it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me. I was playing well in previous years, but this year I felt near on top of my game and that if I played well I'd be hard stopped.\\\"\\nBeing asked to lead his county, lighting up Croke Park, an All-Star nomination; O'Neill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022.\\nHowever, he maintains that any post-mortem on the inter-county campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of Armagh's All-Ireland exit, losing to Galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory.\\nIn an incident-packed encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a six-month suspension for O'Neill's team-mate Tiernan Kelly for eye-gouging, O'Neill scored 0-4 and was the only Orchard player to score in the shootout.\\nHis most memorable contribution, though, came in the dying embers of regulation time, nailing a 50m free to force extra-time after Armagh had roared their way back from a six-point deficit with two injury-time goals. \\nIn extra-time, Jemar Hall's score looked to have sealed a semi-final spot for Armagh before Cillian McDaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout. \\n\\\"You look back at Galway with regrets coming from that game, the way we lost the penalty shootout,\\\" admits O'Neill.  \\n\\\"We didn't really perform in the second half. We had it won in extra-time, lost it again, got back into it. \\n\\\"There are regrets but we feel we've progressed through the year. We let ourselves down in the first game against Donegal but we came back against Tyrone and Donegal (in the qualifiers) and made a bit of a statement. \\n\\\"We were hoping to push on against Galway and get to that semi-final where we felt we'd have a chance coming up against Derry or Clare, it turned out to be Derry.\\n\\\"Then you see how close Galway ran Kerry in the final and it just enters your head 'what if' we did get over the Galway game and the circumstances we did lose, it's a bitter pill to swallow but we've got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year.\\\"\"\n

Here are some of the ways the Autumn Statement will affect you. \\nYou start to pay income tax on annual earnings of more than \\u00a312,570, charged at 20%. You then pay tax of 40% on earnings over \\u00a350,270 a year, although the bands are different in Scotland.\\n- or tax thresholds - had already been frozen until 2026, rather than going up in line with prices as you might normally expect. \\nr has now extended that freeze for a further two years. That means any kind of pay rise could drag you into a higher tax bracket. Even if it does not, it will almost certainly mean a greater proportion of your income is taxed.\\nghest rate of income tax - which is 45% currently on earnings above \\u00a3150,000 - will be paid on earnings of more than \\u00a3125,140 from April instead, the chancellor has announced. That means the highest paid could pay hundreds of pounds more a year in income tax.\\nSpring Statement of March and September's mini-budget both included plans to cut the basic rate of income tax. Unsurprisingly, there were no such promises this time.\\nreshold at which people start to pay inheritance tax will also be frozen, and the dividend allowance (the amount you can receive each year in dividends, if you own shares, before paying tax) will be cut from \\u00a32,000 to \\u00a31,000 next year and then to \\u00a3500 from April 2024. The allowance stood at \\u00a35,000 as recently as 2018.\\nual allowance before capital gains tax is paid will also be reduced from \\u00a312,300 to \\u00a36,000 in April and then to \\u00a33,000 a year later. This tax is paid when you sell an asset, such as company shares or a second home.\\nStrains over the cost of living have centred on rising prices. The rate at which prices rise is measured by inflation, currently at 11.1%, which means that a typical item that cost \\u00a3100 a year ago will cost \\u00a3111.10 today.\\ngood news from the government's independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - is that the inflation rate will drop to 7.4% next year. The target set for inflation is 2%.\\nHowever, a fall in the inflation rate does not mean that prices in the shops will be going down. It just means that they will be going up more slowly than now.\\nOBR said soaring inflation would still hit households' real disposable income - a measure of living standards - by the largest amount since official records began in 1956-57, falling by 4.3% in the year to April.\\nEven so, the OBR forecast that inflation may turn negative, in other words prices may fall by late 2024.\\nAt present, there is a government cap on domestic energy bills, known as the Energy Price Guarantee. It limits the price per unit of energy used, not the total bill. It means that since October, the household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays \\u00a32,500 a year.\\nwas due to expire in April, leaving the prospect of the typical annual bill going up to \\u00a33,700, according to analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight.\\nMr Hunt said that this cap would be extended for a further 12 months, but would be less generous than now - so the typical household pays \\u00a33,000 a year. Mr Hunt predicted that would save the typical household \\u00a3500 in a year.\\ngovernment is also pumping more money into energy efficiency schemes.\\nA host of cost-of-living payments have been made during the latter half of this year, including a \\u00a3400 discount off everyone's energy bills this winter. Others were directed at those on lower-incomes on benefits, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\\nWhile the universal payment will end, there will be more targeted support next year. That will amount to \\u00a3900 to households on means-tested benefits, \\u00a3300 to pensioner households, and \\u00a3150 for those on disability benefits. \\nusing heating oil will receive a payment of \\u00a3200 this winter, rather than \\u00a3100 as previously planned.\\nUnder the \\\"triple lock\\\", the state pension is supposed to increase each year in line with the highest of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index in September), the average increase in wages across the UK, or 2.5%.\\nAfter months of uncertainty, the chancellor confirmed that the state pension would go up by 10.1%, to match inflation.\\nwill see the \\\"new\\\" state pension, currently worth \\u00a3185.15 a week, go up to \\u00a3203.85. The basic state pension, for those who reached state pension age before April 2016, is currently \\u00a3141.85 a week, and will go up to \\u00a3156.20. That can be topped up for those on low incomes with pension credit, which will also go up by 10.1%.\\ngovernment's review on the age at which the state pension is received, currently 66 and going up to 67, will be published early next year.\\nSome disability benefits - such as the personal independence payment - must rise, by law, in line with inflation each year. That happens in April, based on the previous September's inflation figure - which this time is 10.1%.\\nHowever, rises in most means-tested benefits - most significantly universal credit, which is received by about six million people - and tax credits are a decision for ministers.\\nr said these too would go up by 10.1%, which he said would mean a family on universal credit would benefit next year by around \\u00a3600.\\nMr Hunt said the government will cap the increase in social rents in England at a maximum of 7% in 2023-24, rather than the 11% potential rise under previous rules.\\nminimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - is \\u00a39.50 an hour. This will rise to \\u00a310.42 in April - a move that affects about two million people. It is employers who must shoulder this cost.\\nMinisters will have to scrutinise the recommendations for public sector pay rises, such as salary increases for teachers, nurses and the armed forces. Widespread, ongoing disputes are expected.\\nAt present, councils in England must hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 3%, but the chancellor said he would raise this to 5%.\\nOBR said that could see the average Band D council tax bill rise by \\u00a3250 a year by 2027-28.\\nIn September, the government said a cut in stamp duty tax in England and Northern Ireland for some house buyers would be permanent.\\nrice at which stamp duty is paid was doubled from \\u00a3125,000 to \\u00a3250,000 (\\u00a3425,000 for first time buyers) and discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers applied to properties up to \\u00a3625,000, rather than \\u00a3500,000.\\nr has now introduced a deadline, which will see these cuts reversed at the end of March 2025.\\nr has announced electric vehicles will no longer be exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2025.\\nCurrently there are different rates depending on the type of vehicle but electric vehicles are exempt.\\nHow does the Autumn Statement affect you?
