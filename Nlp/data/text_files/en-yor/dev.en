All the animals (Dog, Panther, Leopard, Lion, Monkey, Jackal, Cat, Donkey/Ass, Tortoise etc.) gathered together to discuss the vices they noticed in their wives.   Dog’s wife was said to be committing adultery, Leopard’s wife was insolent, Cat’s wife was stealing, while Monkey’s wife was quarrelsome etc.
All the animals noticed that there was no comment from the Tortoise other than nodding and sighing.  The Lion then asked what Yanibo (Tortoise’s wife) vice was?  The Tortoise rose up and said to the other animals that all the vices they have mentioned could not be compared with his wife’s only vice because “Yanibo has no shame”.
In the United Kingdom, when a Politician commits any act of shame like adultery, stealing, taking bribe, on or before he/she is caught would resign in order not to perverse the cause of justice but killers, thieves, adulterers etc. are common among the Nigerian Politicians because they have no shame.  They use their position to perverse the cause of justice.
This Yoruba Folklore that depicted that “Shamelessness is the king of all Vices” is worthy of note for the people to be mindful of the kind of Politician by casting their votes to elect “Decent” Politicians to repair what the” Shameless” ones has destroyed.


The news on Tuesday, the tenth day of May, 2016, quoted the British Prime Minister, David Cameron calling Nigeria one of the most corrupt nation in the world.  He did not explain that his country has been aiding and abetting corruption by keeping looted funds and making United Kingdom a safe haven for the looters.
Palm Oil is an agricultural produce of economic value particularly in West Africa, hence it was kept often on the ceiling in time past. If anyone stole palm oil from the ceiling where it is kept, and there is no one to receive it, it is either he/she personally consume it or could have been caught quicker.  According to Yoruba proverb that can be interpreted thus, “An accomplice is worse than the offender”.  If the corrupt treasury looters have no accomplice in the UK, such wicked act could have been minimized.
The war being waged against corruption since the newly elected government nearly a year ago, by Muhammad Buhari and Yemi Osinbajo led administration, for treasury looters to face the consequences for their corrupt practices and the stolen fund to be refunded to the Nigerian purse, is commendable.  The British government should pledge during the Anti-corruption Summit schedule to take place in the UK on Thursday, May 12, 2016, their support at recovering the various looted funds and refunding such funds to Nigeria to show that the UK is not an accomplice.


Consumerism has nearly overtaken the purpose of Christmas.  Most people no longer remember that the annual public holiday for every twenty-fifth of December is dedicated to the commemoration of the birth of Jesus.  Many children in the Western World even think “Father Christmas is cooler than Jesus” because Father Christmas gives them gift, but it is now left to the parents and Christians to continue to explain the real reason for the season.
Christmas is not meant to drive people into debt or depression.  For people Oversea, consumerism has driven many into debt and depression because of not having enough to buy gifts and other items being vigorously advertised on the modern communication gadgets such as Television, Radio and on the Internet.
According to Yoruba proverb that said “Masquerade Festival sure has an end” meaning “What has a beginning has an end”.  This year’s Christmas has come and gone.  For those in debt as a result of Christmas, it is now time to begin to pay up the debt even into the New Year.  In preparation for the New Year, it is time for people to resolve to consume according to their means.
Wishing you a joyous New Year.


The Supreme Court upturned the traditional marriage culture in America.  On Friday, June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court once again ruled that “No State in America has the right to prevent gay and lesbian couple from getting married under the Law”.  The struggle for marriage equality has been on since forty six years ago, but in June 2013, the Supreme Court first ruled that “Same Sex Marriage be legalized and given the same right as that of Traditional Marriage” at the Federal level, to afford them such rights as inheritance, tax benefits and divorce.
The Supreme Court ruling was adopted because “Law and Order in America is based on respect for the Constitution and the Rule of Law”.  Since the announcement of this ruling, there has been outcry from all over the World against it, particularly from the Christians who came out to condemn American Government that such ruling is against the Law of God on marriage.
In Yoruba Culture, it is odd and a strange occurrence for a Man to marry a Man or for a Woman to marry a Woman.  In order for family not to go into extinction, child bearing is one of the most important purpose of marriage, hence if a man marries another man, they cannot bear children without adopting a child or have one through surrogate mother or if it is between woman to woman, one of them or both could have had children from previous traditional relationship or look for a man to impregnate one of them.
According to Yoruba adage “The culture in our home could be a taboo in another”, American Same Sex Marriage culture is a still a strange occurrence in Yoruba tradition.  Not all strange occurrence are and not all taboos are good, for example, in time past, it is a taboo to give birth to Albino, or twins.  As a result, one of the twins is either killed or the two of them thrown into the forest to die, but nowadays, the culture of throwing the twins or triplet in the forest has been stopped.  No one should be killed for the reason of colour of the skin or as a result of expression of love preference.  White Americans used their religious beliefs all in the name of Christianity to influence the Constitution to declare that African Americans were not full human beings, hence it was forbidden for Black American to marry a White American.  If they do, neither they nor their children were recognised as complete human being.  Without any consequence for their actions, they hid under this terrible Law to lynch/kill the African Americans in public, mostly after Church Service, without differentiating whether the slaves are from Yoruba land or other African Countries.  It took the American Civil War and amending the Constitution to accommodate a new Federal Law after the war to protect the African Americans from these wicked acts.

In time past, hunting was one of the major livelihoods in Yoruba land.  Only highly skilled hunters killed animals like elephants, leopards, lions and buffalo while the neighbourhood hunters hunted for animals closer to home like squirrels, bush rats, monkeys etc.  Bush meat such as deer stag, deer and the domestic animals like sheep, goats, he-goat, pigs were common sources of meat in those days rather than Cow meat which is common now a days.
Of course such hunting with modern weapons has led to a great reduction in animals such as buffalo, elephants, lions, leopards, while some animals like the rhinoceros have become altogether extinct in Yoruba land. this a good reason why hunting is not exactly still a major livelihood in Yoruba land as it used to be. Of course, it is conceivable, that the modern counterpart of hunting wild game, is the Yoruba person that leaves home for far away places, akin to a wilderness of sorts (the unknown), in search of British pounds & US dollars.
The literal meaning of this Yoruba proverb:  “If the hunter thinks of the suffering in the wild, when he makes a kill, he would not share with anyone” can be applied to those living in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world, who have to earn a living in cold climates & strange cultures. While they think of sending such hard earned money home to help parents and friends, those receiving such help never think of the suffering they have gone through.
We should remember that it takes a very kind person to deny themselves or face the wilderness in order to help others.


In the olden days there was a man named “Igberaga”, he was born into a polygamous home and raised by the other wives of his father because his mother died when he was a child.  He migrated to Lagos (a big city) where he joined a Fishing company after struggling through his teenage life and obtaining Primary Six certificate.
He was prospering in his business, while his father died.  Igberaga decided to return to his father’s estate to claim his own of his father’s vast Cocoa Plantation.  He was able to acquire more plantation beside what was allocated to him as his inheritance.  Prosperity smiles on him more than any of his siblings.  Many of his half brothers and sisters relied on him for financial support.
After a while, he owned more houses and prospered more than anyone in the community.  Beside he continued to acquire more farms, till he acquired his siblings’ inheritance and making them to become tenants.  To crown it all, he began to use them as a labourer in the farm they once owned.  This did not settle well with his brothers as they were now reclined into beggars in their homes and servants to a younger brother.
According to a Yoruba adage, “Excessive behaviour is the father of Disgrace”.  Igberaga engaged in excessive behaviour as he did not stop flaunting his wealth, he was arrogant and flippant at all times, despite warnings from those that know and understand his upbringing.  He refused all the warnings by the elders.  Little did he know that, he was working towards his doom?   One day, he called one of his brothers whom he employed as a labourer, in his original farm and humiliated him because he was poor.  The poor brother lamented, by crying out that; “if you are God you go ahead with your plan, but if you are human like me, you will certainly reap what you sow”.
One morning, Igberaga woke up and could not stand on his feet, he became crippled.  Many attempts were made to find a cure for his illness but to no avail.  This circumstances forced him to sell all his properties and he ended up becoming a beggar.
Lessons from this story teaches that one should not equate wealth with one’s hard work alone, as if the others who are less privileged did not struggle enough.   According to Yoruba proverb “Wealth is not by hard labour or slaving away, but it is by God’s blessing”.


This Yoruba proverb is relevant to describe the ability of an adult to look back and draw from past experience to solve a problem while a child with no previous experience look forward since he/she has no previous experience to fall back on.
There is another Yoruba proverb that said “The one that fell into a ditch teaches the others wisdom”. Though there is an adage that said “Experience is the best Teacher”, often waiting to learn from personal experience may be too costly, so it is better to avoid the cost by learning a lesson from the Elders.  The wise people would always learn from the experience of others to avoid pitfalls.
In this computer age, the proverb that said “if a child falls he/she looks forward, if an elder falls he/she looks back” is still relevant to encourage the young ones, who have more choices of listening and learning directly from the elder or reading the documented experience of others from books or the internet to avoid past mistakes, learn from the strength and weakness of the Elders for future use.


Yoruba often offer sacrifice before the advent of Christianity.  Food are often used for the sacrifice.  This type of food is called “Sacrifice”.  Such sacrifice are usually placed in the open, as a result, there are plenty of free meals for the dogs, birds and other animals on the Streets.
As people’s movement are not restricted like in the modern time, so also are the dogs not in restriction.  Many “Street dogs” roam around to source their meal.  Neighbours can beckon on the stray dog to offer left over meals, hence the reason for the various style of beckoning on dogs.  Check out the above recording the way people in Akure (capital of Ondo State) beckons on the Street dogs in the olden days.
We can use the Yoruba proverb that said “What the dog will eat, the Devil will provide” to compare the kind of food provided by the Devil in the modern days as: Cases, sickness, alcoholism/hard drug or gambling shop.  On the other hand, the dog can be parallel with: Lawyers, Doctors/Herbalists, Pub and Gambling House/machine.
If we observe another Yoruba proverb that “Whether the boss sells or not, the labourer will collect his/her wage”.  This means, whether the Lawyer/Barrister wins a case in court or not, his/her legal fees must be paid, same as whether the sick person is well or not, the Doctor/Herbalist has to be paid.  Whether the Drunkard/Drug addict is intoxicated or not, the Pub-owner’s will be paid.


Traditional Marriage in Yoruba land is a period when the groom and the bride’s family come together, and it is not just an affair between the bride and groom.  It is a joyous event that brings both families together to advice and to pray for the bride and groom.
All the marriage ceremonies can be conducted in a day or spread over many days as in the old days when the family Introduction would often be on one day while the traditional marriage was expected to occur on another date.  In the olden days, when Yoruba marriage were most often conducted moderately, the ceremony was held in the family house or in the bride’s parent’s home, but nowadays, it is mostly conducted in a rented place such as community hall, sport field, hotel, etc.  The culture of hiring a neutral venue began as a result of armed robbery attacks and unscrupulous elements infiltrating the invited guests to cause havoc.  These venues are often secured with a lot of money.
The wealth of the parents often determines how expensive the marriage could be, because it is a thing of joy that children have been trained and they now want to be independent to start their family, but there is now a lot of excesses and show off.  As a result of the huge cost of marriage, there are more event places than libraries.  It is not how expensive that makes a marriage successful, as many marriages are dissolved almost immediately after the huge ceremony.  There is a Yoruba saying that “salt is not consumed according to wealth”, in the midst of poverty in Africa, it is better to conduct a moderate marriage ceremony.  Look out for more series on traditional marriage.
